#cytof analyse
The cleaned data is first analysed using FlowSOM.

The file "runFlowSOM_analyse.R" source the "FlowSOM_analyse.R" file for different seeds and save the result of the analysis.
Paths and markers used for flowSOM has to be updated before use.

Manual gated for panel1 (unstimulated panel) is found from "Manuel_manuelGatingP1.R" which use results from marker gating performed 
and restulting posNeg matrix. 


The file runResultatRegresjonNegBinFraFlowSOM.R source the files resultater_Regression_negbin_manuel_manuel.Rmd and
resultater_Regression_negbin_fraFlowSOM.Rmd for different seeds and different comparison. Only the significant result between the first to 
status_timepoint are saved for each run. Paths have to be changed, and  resultater_Regression_negbin_manuel_manuel.Rmd and
resultater_Regression_negbin_fraFlowSOM.Rmd has to be updated to the research question and covariates used in the analysis. The file
resultater_Regression_negbin_fraFlowSOM.Rmd also find the clusters from different clusterings that are not similar and will be tested for 
significans.

like_klustrePanel1_095.R and like_klustrePanel2_095.R compare the results from different runs to find clusters that similar. The similarity
is also plotted in markerplots to visually conferm the findings. 

then a seed for each panel with all clusters found was chosen to report the findings. for these seeds markerplot, tSNE and result from 
negative binomial regression was visualized using the scripts

the incidence rate ratio results from all comparisons made was visualized using signCytofPlot.R

For each setup:

First run the "cleaning up gating..." file, but remember to inspect the signal/density plots and adjust gates if necessary. 
This will give you a clean dataset to work further on. 
The clean-up gating followed the same approach as described in Fluidigm Technical note PN 400248 B1.

Then by running "marker_gating_...." all files will get a gate for each marker. The script must be adjusted to which markers used, 
and also which type of gating wanted for that marker. This could be gating by the upper density bump, the lower density bump, in the middle between two bumps.
It also have to be adjustet to how many gates wanted, just negative/positive or negative/low/high. 
The script will generate density and signal-signal figures for all files and each marker. 
It also generates 
 * a csv file with the mean gate for each marker and
 * a posNeg R object, which is a list with matrices for all files that is as big as the cleaned data file and for each marker have a value 
   0/1 or 0/1/2 for each cell indicating if this cell is regarded as negative/positive or negative/low/high. 
The posNeg file will later be used for automatical manuel gating
